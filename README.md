>  Version 7.13
>
>  1. Another directory traversal vulnerability, differing from that
>     in WinRAR 7.12, has been fixed.
>
>     When extracting a file, previous versions of WinRAR, Windows versions
>     of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code and UnRAR.dll can be tricked
>     into using a path, defined in a specially crafted archive,
>     instead of user specified path.
>
>     Unix versions of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code
>     and UnRAR library, also as RAR for Android, are not affected.
>
>     We are thankful to Anton Cherepanov, Peter Kosinar, and Peter Strycek
>     from ESET for letting us know about this security issue.
>
>  2. Bugs fixed:
>
>     a) WinRAR 7.12 "Import settings from file" command failed to restore
>        settings, saved by WinRAR versions preceding 7.12;
>
>     b) WinRAR 7.12 set a larger than specified recovery size for compression
>        profiles, created by WinRAR 5.21 and older.

>   6. Windows Vista and 32-bit Windows are not supported anymore.
>      WinRAR requires Windows 7 x64 or later.

> If you do need to install 32-bit versions of WinRAR, you can [configure ir_hardened.ps1](#Usage) as `ir_hardened_x32_701.ps1` to install the most recent 32-bit version of WinRAR.

- Both PowerShell and CMD wrapper support

## Usage

### Install or update WinRAR (hardened installer)

Direct execution (recommended):
```powershell
irm "https://cdn.cyci.org/ir_hardened.ps1" | iex
```

Local execution:
```powershell
.\ir_hardened.ps1
```

Or double‚Äëclick wrapper: ir_hardened.cmd

### License your installed WinRAR (hardened licenser)

Direct execution (recommended):
```powershell
irm "https://cdn.cyci.org/ir_license.ps1" | iex
```

Local execution:
```powershell
.\ir_license.ps1                    # Normal operation (with backup and elevation)
.\ir_license.ps1 -NoBackup          # Skip backup creation
.\ir_license.ps1 -NoElevation       # Don't request admin privileges
```

Or double‚Äëclick wrapper: ir_license.cmd

### Remove WinRAR license (hardened unlicenser)

Direct execution (recommended):
```powershell
irm "https://cdn.cyci.org/ir_unlicense.ps1" | iex
```

Local execution:
```powershell
.\ir_unlicense.ps1                    # Normal operation (with backup and confirmation)
.\ir_unlicense.ps1 -Force             # Skip confirmation prompts
.\ir_unlicense.ps1 -NoBackup          # Skip backup creation
.\ir_unlicense.ps1 -NoElevation       # Don't request admin privileges
.\ir_unlicense.ps1 -Force -NoBackup   # Quick removal without backup
```

Or double‚Äëclick wrapper: ir_unlicense.cmd

## Advanced Usage

### Debug Mode
Enable debug pausing for troubleshooting:
```powershell
# For licensing operations
$env:IR_LICENSE_DEBUG_PAUSE='1'
.\ir_license.ps1

# For unlicensing operations  
$env:IR_UNLICENSE_DEBUG_PAUSE='1'
.\ir_unlicense.ps1
```

### Combining Parameters
```powershell
# Quick license install without backup or elevation requests
.\ir_license.ps1 -NoBackup -NoElevation

# Force remove license without any prompts or backups
.\ir_unlicense.ps1 -Force -NoBackup
```

### CMD Wrapper Usage
```batch
# Install license with backup (default)
ir_license.cmd

# Remove license quickly
ir_unlicense.cmd -force -nobackup
```

## Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Hardening**
- **Smart elevation**: Only requests admin when actually needed, not every time
- **Automatic backups**: License files backed up with timestamps before any changes
- **Fallback protection**: If primary backup fails, falls back to user TEMP directory
- **File verification**: Validates license files are genuine before operations
- **Path safety**: Proper escaping and handling of special characters in paths

### ‚ö° **User Control**
- **Force mode**: Skip confirmation prompts for automated scenarios
- **NoBackup mode**: Disable backups when not wanted
- **NoElevation mode**: Prevent admin privilege requests
- **Debug support**: Pause at key points for troubleshooting

### üîß **Reliability**
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Graceful failures with detailed feedback
- **Operation verification**: Confirms operations actually succeeded
- **Process management**: Handles running WinRAR instances properly
- **Multi-architecture support**: Handles 32-bit, 64-bit, and mixed installations

### üéØ **Ease of Use**
- **One-click operation**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Clear feedback**: Always know what's happening with detailed progress info
- **Toast notifications**: Visual feedback with error handling
- **Both PowerShell & CMD**: Use whatever you prefer, (NOTE) ps1's are available through our CDN, CMD scripts must be downloaded and ran locally

## Evolution from oneclickrar/installrar

InstaRAR's `ir_hardened.ps1` is the spiritual successor to the popular `oneclickrar.cmd` and `installrar.cmd` scripts. We've taken the core concept and hardened it for real-world use:

**What we kept:**
- One-click simplicity 
- Automatic latest version detection
- Silent installation

**What we improved:**
- **Security hardening**: Proper auth handling
- **Process management**: Graceful WinRAR closure before installation  
- **Better error handling**: Comprehensive error checking and user feedback
- **Edge case handling**: Fixed various bugs and race conditions
- **PowerShell native**: No more batch file limitations

## Security Features

**Installation Security:**
- **Publisher verification**: Validates that installers are actually signed by "win.rar GmbH"
- **Safe execution**: Copies installers to controlled temp directories before running
- **Process management**: Properly closes running WinRAR instances to prevent conflicts

**Licensing Security:**
- **Intelligent elevation**: Only requests admin privileges when actually needed
- **Automatic backups**: Creates timestamped backups with fallback locations
- **File verification**: Validates license files before operations
- **Secure elevated operations**: Uses temporary scripts with unique names for elevation
- **Path safety**: Proper escaping and validation of all file paths

**Universal Security:**
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed user feedback
- **Input validation**: Parameter validation with proper types and constraints
- **Operation verification**: Confirms operations actually succeeded before reporting success

## Credits

Built upon the foundation of [neuralpain](https://github.com/neuralpain)'s excellent oneclickwinrar project. We're grateful for the original work on installrar.cmd, oneclickrar.cmd, and unlicenserar.ps1 that inspired this toolkit.

This project represents a complete hardened evolution with enterprise-grade security improvements, comprehensive error handling, and advanced user control features while maintaining the simplicity and effectiveness of the original concept.
