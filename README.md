>
>     When extracting a file, previous versions of WinRAR, Windows versions

>
>     Unix versions of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code
>     and UnRAR library, also as RAR for Android, are not affected.

>     b) WinRAR 7.12 set a larger than specified recovery size for compression

# InstaRAR

**Complete hardened WinRAR toolkit with enterprise-grade security**

## What it does

**WinRAR Installation & Updates:**
- Automatically detects the latest WinRAR version
- Downloads from official sources with multiple fallbacks and smart retry logic
- Enhanced Authenticode signature verification with publisher validation
- SHA256 hash verification with cross-source validation
- Certificate pinning with dynamic retrieval and caching
- Handles existing installations gracefully with version comparison
- Closes running WinRAR instances before installing (with graceful and force termination)
- True silent installation without UI prompts (requires admin privileges)

**WinRAR Licensing Management:**
- Securely installs WinRAR licenses with automatic backups
- Intelligently handles privilege elevation only when needed
- Safely removes licenses with verification and backup options
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Multiple operation modes (Force, NoBackup, NoElevation)

**Universal Features:**
- Enterprise-grade security hardening throughout
- Toast notifications with proper error handling
- Debug support for troubleshooting
- Both PowerShell and CMD wrapper support

## Usage

### Install or update WinRAR (hardened installer)

Direct execution (recommended):
```powershell
irm "https://cdn.cyci.org/ir_hardened.ps1" | iex
```

Local execution:
```powershell
.\ir_hardened.ps1
```

For truly silent installation (no UAC prompts), run as administrator:
```powershell
# Right-click PowerShell and "Run as Administrator", then:
.\ir_hardened.ps1
```

Or double‚Äëclick wrapper: ir_hardened.cmd

> **Note**: The script will work without admin privileges but Windows UAC will prompt for permission during installation. This is the normal behavior of UAC.

### License your installed WinRAR (hardened licenser)

Direct execution (recommended):
```powershell
irm "https://cdn.cyci.org/ir_license.ps1" | iex
```

Local execution:
```powershell
.\ir_license.ps1                    # Normal operation (with backup and elevation)
.\ir_license.ps1 -NoBackup          # Skip backup creation
.\ir_license.ps1 -NoElevation       # Don't request admin privileges
```

Or double‚Äëclick wrapper: ir_license.cmd

### Remove WinRAR license (hardened unlicenser)

Direct execution (recommended):
```powershell
irm "https://cdn.cyci.org/ir_unlicense.ps1" | iex
```

Local execution:
```powershell
.\ir_unlicense.ps1                    # Normal operation (with backup and confirmation)
.\ir_unlicense.ps1 -Force             # Skip confirmation prompts
.\ir_unlicense.ps1 -NoBackup          # Skip backup creation
.\ir_unlicense.ps1 -NoElevation       # Don't request admin privileges
.\ir_unlicense.ps1 -Force -NoBackup   # Quick removal without backup
```

Or double‚Äëclick wrapper: ir_unlicense.cmd

## Advanced Usage

### Debug Mode
Enable debug pausing for troubleshooting:
```powershell
# For licensing operations
$env:IR_LICENSE_DEBUG_PAUSE='1'
.\ir_license.ps1

# For unlicensing operations  
$env:IR_UNLICENSE_DEBUG_PAUSE='1'
.\ir_unlicense.ps1
```

### Combining Parameters
```powershell
# Quick license install without backup or elevation requests
.\ir_license.ps1 -NoBackup -NoElevation

# Force remove license without any prompts or backups
.\ir_unlicense.ps1 -Force -NoBackup
```

### CMD Wrapper Usage
```batch
# Install license with backup (default)
ir_license.cmd

# Remove license quickly
ir_unlicense.cmd -force -nobackup
```

## Evolution from oneclickrar/installrar

InstaRAR's `ir_hardened.ps1` is the spiritual successor to the popular `oneclickrar.cmd` and `installrar.cmd` scripts. We've taken the core concept and hardened it for real-world use:

**What we kept:**
- One-click simplicity 
- Automatic latest version detection
- Silent installation

**What we improved:**
- **Enhanced security hardening**: Multi-layer security with certificate pinning, hash verification, and comprehensive audit logging
- **Smart installation logic**: Prevents multiple simultaneous installations and handles edge cases gracefully
- **Advanced process management**: Enhanced WinRAR detection with graceful and force termination options
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Detailed error checking, recovery options, and user feedback with security event logging
- **Enterprise-grade reliability**: Smart retry logic, installation verification, and robust edge case handling
- **True silent operation**: Properly configured silent installation (requires admin privileges for full automation)
- **PowerShell native**: Modern PowerShell implementation with advanced security features

## Security Features

- **Installation verification**: Multi-point validation to ensure successful installation
- **Security event logging**: Comprehensive audit trail in Windows Event Log

**Licensing Security:**
- **Intelligent elevation**: Only requests admin privileges when actually needed
- **Automatic backups**: Creates timestamped backups with fallback locations
- **File verification**: Validates license files before operations
- **Secure elevated operations**: Uses temporary scripts with unique names for elevation
- **Path safety**: Proper escaping and validation of all file paths

**Universal Security:**
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed user feedback
- **Input validation**: Parameter validation with proper types and constraints
- **Operation verification**: Confirms operations actually succeeded before reporting success

## Credits

Built upon the foundation of [neuralpain](https://github.com/neuralpain)'s excellent oneclickwinrar project. We're grateful for the original work on installrar.cmd, oneclickrar.cmd, and unlicenserar.ps1 that inspired this toolkit.

This project represents a complete hardened evolution with enterprise-grade security improvements, comprehensive error handling, and advanced user control features while maintaining the simplicity and effectiveness of the original concept.
