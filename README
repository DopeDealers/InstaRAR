oneclickwinrar - install and license WinRAR
-------------------------------------------

there was a need for something versatile // so why not?

oneclickrar.cmd - download, install and license WinRAR
installrar.cmd - download and install WinRAR
licenserar.cmd - license WinRAR if installed

- all operations are done at `C:\Program Files\WinRAR`
- check the releases page for downloads (or download from the repository; whichever you prefer)
